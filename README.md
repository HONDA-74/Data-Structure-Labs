# 🧪 Data Structure Labs – Lab 1

This repository contains **Lab 1** of the Data Structure course, implemented in **C++**.  
The lab includes implementations of classic **sorting** and **searching** algorithms, as well as a swap function using references.

---

## 📌 Contents

### 🔄 1. Swap By Reference  
A simple function that swaps two integers using **references**.

---

## 🔢 Sorting Algorithms

### 🟡 2. Bubble Sort  
- Compares adjacent elements  
- Swaps them if needed  
- Stops early when the array is already sorted  

---

### 🟦 3. Merge Sort  
- A **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithm  
- Splits the array into halves  
- Recursively merges them in sorted order  

---

### 🔥 4. Quick Sort  
- Uses **partitioning**  
- Places the pivot in the correct position  
- Recursively sorts left & right subarrays  

---

### 🏔️ 5. Heap Sort  
- Builds a **max heap**  
- Extracts the max element repeatedly  
- Overall complexity: **O(n log n)**  

---

## 🔍 Searching Algorithms

### 🔎 6. Sequential Search (for Sorted Arrays)  
- Scans the array  
- Can stop early when arr[i] > key  

---

### 🎯 7. Binary Search  
Implemented in two versions:

- **Iterative Binary Search**  
- **Recursive Binary Search**  

Both return the index of the element or `-1` if not found.
