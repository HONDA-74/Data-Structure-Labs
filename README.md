# 🧪 Data Structure Labs

This repository contains **Data Structure Labs** implemented in **C++** as part of the course.  
Each lab focuses on fundamental data structures and algorithms, including sorting, searching, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, hash tables, and graphs.

## 📌 Labs Overview

### 🔄 Lab 1 – Sorting & Searching
Includes implementations of classic **sorting** and **searching** algorithms, as well as a swap function using references.

**Contents:**
1. **Swap By Reference** – Swap two integers using references  
2. **Bubble Sort** – Compares adjacent elements, stops early if sorted  
3. **Merge Sort** – Divide-and-Conquer recursive sort  
4. **Quick Sort** – Partitioning & recursive sorting  
5. **Heap Sort** – Max heap construction and extraction  
6. **Sequential Search** – For sorted arrays, early stopping  
7. **Binary Search** – Iterative & Recursive versions
